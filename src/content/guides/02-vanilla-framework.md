I have been working with Tailwind CSS recently and wow is it efficient to work with. But sometimes you need an "enterprise" friendly or more "industrial" look. 

Then I found Ubuntu's [Vanilla](https://vanillaframework.io/) CSS framework. 

Here is an [Astro](https://github.com/getmarkus/astro-vanilla-framework) template to show off some capablities.

* SASS/SCSS framework
* Minimal
* Well used and tested (Ubuntu products)
* Alpine.js friendly
* Permissive license

Ubuntu* - not affiliated (just a fan)

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template getmarkus/astro-vanilla-framework
```
