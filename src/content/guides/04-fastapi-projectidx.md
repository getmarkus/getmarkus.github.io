- [Project IDX](https://developers.google.com/idx): A cloud-based development environment by Google that offers a browser-first workspace for coding, featuring built-in AI assistance and seamless integration with development tools
- [FastAPI Full Template](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/project-generation/): A production-ready project generator for FastAPI applications that includes user management, authentication, SQLAlchemy models, and Docker configuration out of the box

What is going on here?

1. The FastAPI Full Templateâ€™ Copier template is executed with default answers (-l)

   ```bash
   copier copy -l '[https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template)' my-awesome-project --trust
   ```

2. React frontend is installed and built

   ```bash
   npm ci --no-audit --prefer-offline --no-progress --timing
   ```

3. PostgreSQL database is built and started via Docker Compose

   ```bash
   docker compose up db prestart
   ```

4. FastAPI backend is started

   ```bash
   fastapi dev app/main.py
   ```

5. Backend tests are executed as a Smoke Test

   ```bash
   ./scripts/test.sh
   ```

6. IDXâ€™s Web Preview is started

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Configuration

By default the [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) will execute with default values:

## Known Issues

Note: In order to allow the frontend to talk to the backend the backend port must be made [**Public**](https://community.idx.dev/t/early-preview-of-public-ports/1911). Why? Dunno.
